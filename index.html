    <h1>3D Ocean Simulation Project</h1>
    
    <p>The objective of this project is to create a 3D ocean simulation using mesh deformation, the Fast Fourier Transform, and 3D graphic shaders. This project will use many computational geometry techniques, such as ray tracing, and triangulation, as well as more advanced mathematical topics, such as space partitioning, frequency and time domain analysis, and oceanographic spectra, which when combined, aim to produce realistic and dynamic visualizations of ocean surfaces and subsurface interactions.</p>
    
    <p>Realistic ocean simulations exist already, both in many modern games, and just ocean simulations by themselves. This project aims to accomplish similar things to past implementations, but with a web-deliverable. Many ocean simulations are full-fledged games, written in C++ or C# in Unreal Engine or Unity. This project aims to work entirely in the browser, using WASM and WebGL to render 3D environments in the browser. The implementation language of choice will be Rust.</p>
